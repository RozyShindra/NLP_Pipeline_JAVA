A Java project exploring important features of Natural Language Processing (NLP) using **Stanford CoreNLP**.  

This project demonstrates various NLP tasks including tokenization, sentence splitting, part-of-speech tagging, lemmatization, named entity recognition, parsing, sentiment analysis, and more.

## ðŸ”¹ Features

The project uses **Stanford CoreNLP** to implement the following NLP features:

- **Tokenization** â€“ Split text into words/tokens.
- **Sentence Splitting** â€“ Divide text into sentences.
- **Part-of-Speech (POS) Tagging** â€“ Identify grammatical roles like noun, verb, adjective.
- **Lemmatization** â€“ Convert words to their base form.
- **Named Entity Recognition (NER)** â€“ Detect entities like persons, organizations, and locations.
- **Parsing** â€“ Generate syntactic parse trees.
- **Dependency Parsing** â€“ Find grammatical relationships between words.
- **Coreference Resolution** â€“ Link pronouns to proper nouns.
- **Sentiment Analysis** â€“ Detect sentiment of sentences (positive, negative, neutral).
- **Open Information Extraction (OpenIE)** â€“ Extract relationships and triplets from text.
